# The relayr C# SDK

The relayr C# SDK allows you to access all of that sweet relayr sensor data and [cloud platform](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Platform) functionality from, you guessed it, apps built in C#!

Built as a portable class library, you'll be able to use the same SDK across Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows Desktop Apps.
